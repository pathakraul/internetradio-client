# internetradio-client
A small internet radio client in python using shoutcast service apis

I will continue to add more features and support for new ways to search  shoutcast channels

#Usage
./internetradio.py --genre <GENRE>

#Requirements
You need to have your shoutcast DevId to make this work. Once you have it, set the "devId" variable in the internetradio.py
